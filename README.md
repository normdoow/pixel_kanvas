# pixel_kanvas
Pixel Kanvas was a big project I worked on my Junior year of College. It is a web app game where people could come and make pixel art in real time together! It was really cool!! It uses Firebase as the backend. I started the project at a hackathon with my friends and we actually ended up winning award from Google themselves! It was a lot of fun. The site was up at www.pixelkanvas.com and had around 500 unique visitors but after that I then turned my attention to other projects and eventually I took the site down. You can see what it used to look like from this video trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuoc4G4JA2g or this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W39e2yYp6SE&amp;t=2s
